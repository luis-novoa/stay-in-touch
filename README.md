```
![Terminal with the required code](./app/assets/readme-imgs/step2.png)

Now you have the project files in your computer, but you'll not be able to save any changes on github since you're not the owner or a collaborator of this project. If you want to that, you can fork this project clicking the "Fork" button in the repository's page, which will create a repository named "<yourUserName>/headphones-shop". Follow the aforementioned instructions to download it to your computer.

Now you can edit the project as you please and save your changes on your forked repository on github following the git flow. If you're not familiarized with this concept, follow [this guide about the Git Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/git-basics) developed by The Odin Project.

If you have contributions to make, send me a message telling me about your ideas. If we agree on a change, you can code your modifications in your forked repository and create a pull request following these steps:

1 - Click on the "New pull request" button on your forked repository.
